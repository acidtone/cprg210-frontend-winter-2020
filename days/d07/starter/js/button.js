// Step 1: declare a variable named 'counter' and assign it to the <span> element that states the number of clicks. This will be zero the first time the page loads.

function handleClick() {
  // This function will run any time your button is clicked.

  // Step 2: Find the current number of times clicked (hint: try innerText) and assign it to a variable called 'currentCount'.

  // Step 3: Increment currentCount by one

  // Step 4: Udpate the counter using the method we learned yesterday (*cough*innerText*cough*).

  // Step 5: Using the classList API, add the class of 'active' to the to change the `background-color` of the <body> element.

  // Step 6: Using one if/else statement, toggle the body background: add the 'active' class when it's missing and remove it when it's present.

  // Bonus step: Add a Lorem Picsum <img> that changes whenever the button is clicked. Use the current counter value as an image id. Hint: you can dynamically set an element's attributes with `element.setAttribute()`
