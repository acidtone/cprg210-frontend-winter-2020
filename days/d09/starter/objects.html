    // Step 1: It would be better practice to not embed the image width and height in imgURL. Add two new properties (named 'imageWidth' and 'imageHeight') to 'puppy'. Modify your imgURL to not include width and height values and instead move them to puppy.imageWidth and puppy.imageHeight.
    const puppy = {
      name: 'Rayden Stormlord',
      colour: 'black (as his heart)',
      imgURL: 'https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/200'
    }

    // Step 2: Modify this content string to use puppy.imageWidth and puppy.heightHeight in the image's src attribute
    const content =   `<article>
                        <h1>${puppy.name}</h1>
                        <p>Colour: ${puppy.colour}</p>
                        <img src="${puppy.imgURL}" alt="Cutness Attack: ${puppy.name}">
                      </article>`;

    // Step 3: Add a puppy.hobbies property that contains an array of Rayden Stormlord's favourite things to do. He's been seen playing fetch and chasing his tail. Naps are pretty huge to puppies.

    // Step 4: Modify the above content string to list Rayden Stormlord's hobbies as an ordered list

    // Bonus Step: Try adding a method (i.e. a function) to puppy that returns the original imgURL containing width and height values. Maybe name it getImgUrl?

    // assign our container element to a variable
    const main = document.querySelector('main');
    // innerHTML will parse the content string as HTML and create the proper elements in the DOM
    main.innerHTML = content;

    // console.log(main);
