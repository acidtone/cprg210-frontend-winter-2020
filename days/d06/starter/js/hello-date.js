// Create a date object and assign it to a variable


// Replace the [date] placeholder by assigning the current year to innerText of the span element. Note: only use innerHTML when you need to assign/retrieve HTML content.


// Change the title to match with concatenation. Note: HTML elements are not allowed inside the title element (title can have no children).
