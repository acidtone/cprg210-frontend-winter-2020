# HTML and CSS Assignment
## Due
This assignment is due TBD.

## Value
This assignment will be marked out of 30 points and will be worth 50% of the frontend portion of this course (25% of the total course mark).

## Requirements
- Create 3 pages named “index.html”, “register.html”, and “contact.html”.

### index.html
  - Create a [hero section](https://envato.com/blog/exploring-hero-image-trend-web-design/) at the top of the page that:
    - is semantically marked up in a `header` tag
    - is the full width and height of the viewport
    - displays an `h1` heading with the text "Welcome to Travel Experts" inside it.
    - contains a `background-image` and at least one `background-color` declaration
  - Using an `img` tag, display a logo at the top of the page. You may also use an icon font in place of an image. 
  - Display a gallery of travel pictures below the hero section.
  - In a `footer` at the bottom of the page, display copyright information (hint: search for html entities and/or icon fonts to find a copyright symbol).

### contact.html
- Use lists and paragraph tags to display the contact information for the agency and the individual agents.

### register.html
- Set up a form that has fields for entering and submitting customer data. Since you don’t have a server-side script to process the data, try using a free [static form service](https://css-tricks.com/a-comparison-of-static-form-providers/).
- Using a media query, try changing your form from one-column (mobile; label sits above the input field) to two-column (tablet+; labels and inputs sit side-by-side). Use `max-width` to keep your form usable on large screens.
- Ensure that the input tags in your form all have enough contrast to be readable by all users.

### Global requirements
- Each page should have the same global navigation using `nav`, `ul`, `li` and `a` tags to link each page to each other. Include your logo somewhere in the navigation (note: it doesn't necessarily need to be in your nav list).  
- Define style settings that will set the font family, size, and color of the text in your tags. You are free to use a font service for this.
- Download and `link` to an external stylesheet page that will reset your styles to defaults (hint: normalize.css is a popular option)
- Create an external stylesheet file and `link` it into your pages to provide custom style settings.

## Marking Rubric
Hand in your source code files by saving them in a .zip file and dropping it into the drop folder on Brightspace.

Your mark is based on submitted work. Code will be examined using the following criteria.

PLEASE NOTE: Assignments are due on the date specified by the instructor. One mark will be subtracted if the files are submitted within one week of the due date. Files submitted after 1 week of the due date will have one mark subtracted per additional day beyond one week that the file is late.

- 2 points: HTML and CSS some errors but an attempt has been made to fix them.
- 1 point: HTML and CSS are a long way from validating.

- 2 points: Some of the required information is missing.
- 1 point: No identifying documentation.

### Filename

- 2 points: File name is not entirely clear on the required information.
- 1 point: File name has none of the required information.
